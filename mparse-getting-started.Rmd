## Introduction

This tutorial aims to help you get started to build and run custom
models using the model building functionality `mparse()` in
**SimInf**.  I assume you have already installed R
(https://www.r-project.org) and an editor, for example, Emacs Speaks
Statistics (ESS) (https://ess.r-project.org/) or the RStudio IDE
(https://www.rstudio.com).  **SimInf** uses C code internally to
ensure high performance of the simulator and the `mparse` function
automatically generates the necessary C code for a model and you do
not need to know any C programming in order to use it.  However,
`mparse()` requires that a C compiler is installed in order to
transform the generated C code into a module that is dynamically
loaded and used internally in **SimInf**.  We will return to the
details later.

## Software installation instructions

#### Windows

The C compiler toolchain on Windows is called `Rtools`
(https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Download
`Rtools35.exe` (assuming you are using a recent/latest version of R)
and then run the installer. In my experience, using the default
options during the installation works fine.  After installing
`Rtools`, you need to add the path `C:/Rtools/bin` (assuming you
installed to the default directory) to the system `PATH` environment
variable. One way to do that is to update the `PATH` variable in the
System Properties dialog box. Another way is to specify the path to
`Rtools` when R starts. During
[startup](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html),
R reads some files to load user-specific settings and one such file is
`.Rprofile` in your home directory. If you run the following in your R
terminal, where the `~` (tilde) character is a shorthand for your home
directory, then the `.Rprofile` file is created with the path to
`Rtools`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filename <- "~/.Rprofile"
if (file.exists(filename)) {
    ## Do not overwrite the file if it exists.
    stop("The '~/.Rprofile' already exists")
} else {
    path <- "Sys.setenv(PATH = paste0('C:/Rtools/bin;', Sys.getenv('PATH')))"
    writeLines(text = path, con = filename)
}
```

#### macOS

The C compiler toolchain on macOS is called `Xcode` and can be
installed via the App Store or downloaded from `developer.apple.com`
(https://developer.apple.com/download/).

#### Linux

The C compiler toolchain is installed on your system if you have
successfully installed **SimInf**.

## Test the installation

Now, let us check that we can build and run a user-defined
model. First, we load **SimInf** in R using the following command.

```{r, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(SimInf)
```

We will return to the details later, for now we just want to check
that the installation works and that we can use the model parser to
create, for example, a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. Let
`beta` denote the transmission rate, `gamma` the recovery rate, `u0`
the initial population and `tspan` the time span to simulate a
trajectory.

```{r}
model  <- mparse(transitions = c("S -> beta*S*I/(S+I+R) -> I",
                                 "I -> gamma*I -> R"),
                 compartments = c("S", "I", "R"),
                 gdata = c(beta = 0.16, gamma = 0.077),
                 u0 = data.frame(S = 100, I = 1, R = 0),
                 tspan = 1:100)
```

Now, you can type `model` or `summary(model)` to display some basic
model information.

```{r}
model
```

Let us now check if it works to run the `SIR` model. For
reproducibility, we first call the `set.seed()` function.

```{r test-installation, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
set.seed(22)
result <- run(model)
plot(result)
```

The result from one realisation of the SIR model if the simulation
worked.
