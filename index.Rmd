<blockquote><p>A flexible and efficient framework for data-driven
stochastic disease spread simulations</p></blockquote>

The [SimInf R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SimInf)
provides an efficient and very flexible framework to conduct
data-driven epidemiological modeling in realistic large scale disease
spread simulations. The framework integrates infection dynamics in
subpopulations as continuous-time Markov chains using the Gillespie
stochastic simulation algorithm and incorporates available data such
as births, deaths and movements as scheduled events at predefined
time-points. Using C code for the numerical solvers and 'OpenMP' (if
available) to divide work over multiple processors ensures high
performance when simulating a sample outcome. One of our design goals
was to make the package extendable and enable usage of the numerical
solvers from other R extension packages in order to facilitate complex
epidemiological research. The package contains template models and can
be extended with user-defined models.
