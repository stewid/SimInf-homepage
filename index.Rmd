<blockquote><p>A flexible and efficient framework for data-driven
stochastic disease spread simulations</p></blockquote>

The package provides an efficient and very flexible framework to
conduct data-driven epidemiological modeling in realistic large scale
disease spread simulations. The framework integrates infection
dynamics in subpopulations as continuous-time Markov chains using the
Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm and incorporates available
data such as births, deaths and movements as scheduled events at
predefined time-points. Using C code for the numerical solvers and
'OpenMP' (if available) to divide work over multiple processors
ensures high performance when simulating a sample outcome. One of our
design goals was to make the package extendable and enable usage of
the numerical solvers from other R extension packages in order to
facilitate complex epidemiological research. The package contains
template models and can be extended with user-defined models.
