<blockquote><p>A flexible and efficient framework for data-driven
stochastic disease spread simulations</p></blockquote>

Livestock movements are important for the spread of many infectious
diseases between herds. The package provides an efficient and flexible
framework for data-driven stochastic disease spread modelling that
integrates within-herd infection dynamics as continuous-time Markov
chains and livestock movements between herds as scheduled events. The
core simulation solver is implemented in C and uses OpenMP (if
available) to divide work over multiple processors. The package
contains template models and can be extended with user defined models.
