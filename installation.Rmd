The most recent stable version of **SimInf** is available from the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SimInf and may, depending on your
platform, be available in source form or compiled binary form.  The
development version is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/stewid/SimInf.  A binary form of **SimInf** for
macOS or Windows can be installed directly from CRAN.  However, if you
install **SimInf** from source (from CRAN or a \code{.tar.gz} file),
the installation process requires a C compiler, and that the GNU
Scientific Library (GSL) is installed on your system and is on the
path.  Note that GSL (https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) is not an R
add-on package, but needs to be installed separately, for example,
from a terminal using:

- `sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev` on Debian and Ubuntu
- `sudo yum install gsl-devel` on Fedora, CentOS or RHEL
- `brew install gsl` on macOS with the Homebrew package manager

On Windows, the GSL files are downloaded, if needed, from
https://github.com/rwinlib/gsl during the installation of **SimInf**.
Furthermore, when you install **SimInf** from source, depending on
features of the compiler, the package is compiled with support for
OpenMP.  To find out more about installing R add-on packages in
general, the *R Installation and Administration*
(https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) manual describes the process
in detail.

## Install the latest stable release on CRAN

Run the following to install the released version of `SimInf` from
CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SimInf).

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("SimInf")
```

## Install the development version from GitHub

Use the `remotes` package to install the development version from
GitHub (https://github.com/stewid/SimInf).

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_github("stewid/SimInf")
```
